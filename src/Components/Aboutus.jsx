        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>At Zappos.com, our purpose is simple: to live and deliver WOW.</p>
        <p>Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold shoes. Today, we still sell
          shoes —— as well as cloathing, handbags, accessories, and more. That "more" is providing the very best customer service
          customer experience, and company culture. We aim to inspire the world by showing its possible to simultaneously deliver happiness
          to customers, employees, vendors, shareholders, and the community in a long-term, sustainable way.
          <br />
          <br />
          We hope that in the future people won't even realise we started selling shoes online. insted, they'll know Zappos as a
          service company that just happens to sell _______.
